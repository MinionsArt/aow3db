A large proportion of Tigrans worship a new incarnation of the ancient Fire Wizard-god Yaka as the Sun God. Tigran ferocity is legendary. The most devout strive to unleash their inner predator, seeing mercy as weakness. They worship the sun and track the cycle of day and night; life and death. Their natural curiosity about necromancy and the passing of regal souls into kingdoms of glory in the afterlife inspires them to construct massive tombs.<br>Tigrans are lean, muscular and agile. They are clever with magic and move quickly across the battlefield, able to avoid many obstacles in combat. Many are masters of the flame, which they believe pleases their god.",
