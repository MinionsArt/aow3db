Outwardly very similar to humans, their inner peace and nature resembled that of the elves. Always helping humanity, their most fervent goal was fighting and obliterating the undead, who they saw as their ultimate nemesis. They eventually left, leaving behind tombs of warriors in large necropoles. By some cruel twist of fate, they eventually rose from their resting places as undead themselves. Nothing like their former selves, these Archon Revenants are soulless beings intend on spreading death and destruction.",

With no regard to the intelligent creatures that dragons might become in time, the humans devastated the dragon kin. The Dragons turned to the Wizards of Evermore, using powerful magic to create a new breed of followers. They sacrificed their remaining young for the power to keep the humans at bay. The dragons unleashed the power in their eggs, vowing that once they achieved supremacy they would reform themselves into ancient dragonkind again. Draconians recover from their wounds more quickly than other races, and are resistant to fire while being more vulnerable to the cold.
