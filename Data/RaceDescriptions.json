Outwardly very similar to humans, their inner peace and nature resembled that of the elves. Always helping humanity, their most fervent goal was fighting and obliterating the undead, who they saw as their ultimate nemesis. They eventually left, leaving behind tombs of warriors in large necropoles. By some cruel twist of fate, they eventually rose from their resting places as undead themselves. Nothing like their former selves, these Archon Revenants are soulless beings intend on spreading death and destruction.",

Each Dragon type to emerge represented one element; ranging from metals and gems to fire and frost. The Giants came next, shaping the land in finer detail, often changing what the Dragons had formed. This is thought to be the source of the fiercy animosity between the two races.
