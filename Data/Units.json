Many a young cook has discovered their cooking eggs hatching, and what came out was not a sweet little baby animal, as is the case in most of the tasty animal world. I once lost an entire breakfast crew, slaughtered by the unexpected hatching of a clutch of eggs. Their fiery spit and nasty bite had overwhelmed my cooks. By the time I discovered them, most of the hatchlings had fed so well that I had to call the city guard to remove fully transformed draconian flamers, crushers and chargers. Which good cooks know are far too gamey to be good eating.\" <br> <i>--Cooking all of Nature, by Emibeek, Ogre Gourmet</i>\"",

No animal traverses rugged terrain with such speed. Though legends vary, most agree she was captured by a clever and nameless Axeman who demanded she marry him. Together they started a family and formed a clan. Later rival clans started to include boar riders as well. Nowadays boar riders are common from many origins, and still they revere the nameless Axeman by wielding a poleaxe, and they spare no expense on the finest dwarven armor in honor of the love the wild dwarf woman had for her boar..\" <br> <i>--Dwarf Society Made Simple, by Lord Milligan</i>\"",

Dressed as a Jester, Beaver stole a wagonload of pyrotechnics and hid himself in a forested wilderness. When the Phobian Empire came for him, Beaver repelled them with his explosive projectiles. Over time many Halflings joined him and Beaver led them all to freedom. To this day, their descendants wear costumes and keep fireworks handy for the defense of their kin. Well, that, and they really love blowing things up.\" <br> <i>--Half a History, by Lamuel Samanite, Lorekeeper</i>\"",

It's something of a game among the wee folk, and playing on the other side are the Nightwatch, who patrol the streets, keeping society \"honest\"-or so they say. I suspect the local thieves guilds secretly bankroll these infantryman, because they never seem to catch Halfling thieves. Instead, they focus on foreigners not familiar with the ways these stealthy guards sneak about, often more efficiently hidded in the shadows than the rogues they claim to hunt. It is no wonder that Nightwatchmen are said to have once been thieves themselves.

He pretended to shoot just a fraction better than his competitors. We were about to award him the gold prize, when a servant girl, who'd fallen in love with him, noticed his strange scars. The tips of his pointed ears were missing, but Nockfeather was an elf. Elves are prohibited from competing in Archery events. Disqualified, Nockfeahter fled through thick forest with freakish elven speed, never to be seen again. Still, officials must inspect the ears of all competitors, because Elven Archers are too skilled with the longbow.\" <br> <i>--The Commonwealth Games Rulebook, under 'Nockfeather's rule</i>\"",

Then a man in robes, entirely unfit for battle, appeared beside my brother's body. The priest snatched out the blade and quenched the wound with a prayer to the Allfather. I gasped as my brother rose to his feet, a fresh scar covering the place that was a torrent of blood just a moment before. The priest lifted the sword above his head and said we were chosen by a greater power, and that, if we did not doubt, we'd vanquish this evil. He cast down the orc blade, It broke at the hilt. Before I could cower, I was rushing the enemy with such ferocity that they faltered before we destroyed them.\" <br> <i>--Allfather Book of Miracles, Testimony of convert Jenn Plowright.</i>\"",

The wagon shook violently and the horse team took off like a pair of comets. I was flung into the back of the caravan, tangled in a rope.

    "description": "\"There's a fable about a girl in a crimson cloak who meets a Warg. The Warg convinces her to pick some flowers, while it rushes ahead to eat her granny. I assure all children out there, that even if your parents are not trying to kill you by letting you wander a warg-infested forest alone, a real warg won't stop to talk, it will eat you. Sure, wargs are smarter than average wolves, but they are also more vicious. Further, it is unlikely to find just one warg, because they hunt in packs. The Moral of the story: Even if your parents want to kill you; disobey and don't enter a warg-infested forest alone.\" <br> <i>--Fables that Mock Evil, by Chastity Flowers, Storyteller</i>\"",

As the cavern filled with fire, a horse, bright like a tiger, leaped through the flames. Its hooves spat fire as it clomped on the stones beside me. I thought I would die. It bent down and nuzzled my cookpot. I knew then we had a deal. I grabbed my pot with an overmitt, jumped onto its lowered neck. We dashed to safety. Though the fire singed the hair from my toes, the Felhorse was untouched by the inferno. When we stopped, I opened my steaming cookpot.

One pleaded to his grandfather, another cowered at the disapproving spirit of his grandmother. Later, I asked Raidek why a druid would summon the ancestral spirits of his attackers. He explained, 'We all carry spirits with us, pieces of ourselves. There's always one pricking the conscience, displeased with the direction of our lives.

The ship's cannons punched splintery holes in the pirate ships that were thirstely swallowed by the sea. Men fled in every direction, abandoning their ships whenever the Emperor's vessel focussed its wrath towards them. Soon nothing remained of the rebellion but a fog of smoke, a sea of broken timbers, and a single smoking island of churning steel.'\" <br> <i>--The Battle on Brick Sea, by Grig Cantlebottom, Imperial Poet</i>\"",

The Bone Collector scuttled onto our battlefield, drawn to the dying. Trundling over all obstacles, taking no sides, it gathered both elf and orc corpses. The jumbled mountain bones grew in strength and power. I had no choice but to order my orc battalions to attack it. Remarkably, the elves did the same. Our archers did little - for how effective is an arrow against a pile of bones?'\" <br> <i>--Battlefield Horrors, by Lady Loki</i>\"",

A flame tank discharged a torrent of fire over the company, singeing friend and foe alike, but the Gold Wyvern's scales sparkled with renewed health. It launched into the sky seeking a blight-tusk boar. It landed on the vile thing's back, carving out a mass of rotted flesh. The boar spun and struck the sturdy wyvern, denting a scale. Still, no sickness grew in the small wound. The wyvern slew the sickened boar, then flew to hunt new prey.'\" <br> <i>--Defending the Precipice, by Kelesy Chunkwater, Naturalist</i>\"",

The reason why I am still alive is simple, I give all credit for my survival entirely to my steed Foxy, an Obsidian Wyvern, whose skill in flight and stealth has kept me alive on more than one occasion. I prefer to use her as a spy. She sees everything. With the exception of a full grown dragon, she can take care of herself against anything with hostile intentions. Of course, Foxy's something of a coward too. If we run up against something too tough, she'll be the first to flee.'\" <br> <i>--Intelligence and Common Sense, by Amos Ondbay, Spy</i>\"",

The enemy hit us with everything they had. I was strong, though many times I thought it was my last breath. A stabbing to the gut, a crushing blow to my skull, a severing blow to my shoulder, yet none wounded me and I fought on. Then it was done and I rejoiced. I ran to find him who blessed me. To my horror, I saw him smiling, his gut bleeding, his arm severed, his head broken. He died for me. That is why I now die for you. I am a martyr.'\" <br> <i>--Prayer of Martyrs, Author Unknown</i>\"",

They may be weak in ones and twos, but he who pulls their strings, Will watch in silent reverie, plotting certain doom. And feed his friends on rotten things best left inside the tomb. They warned him when armies came to cut his children down, They helped him set the trap, spying as they entered town. Then when they fled, they hunted dead, savoring their cries, Cackling as armies cut them up, and feasted on their eyes. Shady fragments catch the wind, where once a battle raged. Pockets of smoke, rusted blades, and the flocks of crying maids. The battle won, before begun, the clever rogue, all along, Listened to the Grimbeak Crows' chortling chaotic song.'\" <br> <i>--Lost Warsongs, by Willa Loveday</i>\"",

His face sprung alive announcing the name, as if he finally understood all our questions about the fall of the Archons. Before he could explain, the great slab covering the massive stone coffin flew open, crushing the scholar. In the center of this tomb, the animated remains of a titan rose, its eyes glowing wickedly. Swinging a mace the size of a horse, it swung at me. I jumped through the exit hallway as walls around me exploded into a hail of splinters and rubble. Only I survived the temple's collapse. Only I live to record this tale. I hope that the horrors we found stay buried in that ruin.''\" <br> <i>--Expedition to Starwall, by Ricker the Third, Ranger</i>\"",

Soon, it was all we could do to please her. Even the caravan's livestock obeyed her. And we would have done anything for her to scratch us behind the ear the way she did my horse. We fought to give her everything we had, and she rewarded us with a touch on the chin. It was more than generous so we wished her happily on her way. Eventually we came to our senses. None of us wanted to report to King Jorsen how we'd given away all our treasure to a forest nymph, so we pummeled one another and told him we'd been robbed by bandits.'\" <br> <i>--Trading Places, by Jadon Chandler, Merchant</i>\"",
